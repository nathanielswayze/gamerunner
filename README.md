Decompilation and Open-Source Replacement of the GameMaker Studio runner providing backwards compatibility.

## Why make a project like this?
I've recently been researching code on the GameMaker data.win (or game.unx) file and was wondering why no one has attempted to research/decompile the GameMaker runner file, thus it led to this. I've also hated that runners aren't able to be backwards compatable with older game files.

## How can I contribute?
Right now this project is just in the early stages, so the best way you could contribute is by submitting either a [Pull Request](https://github.com/nathanielswayze/gamerunner/pulls) or an [Issue](https://github.com/nathanielswayze/gamerunner/issues) with any research or any decompiling code you would like to help with.

## What platforms are you going to target?


# Goals
- [ ] Compiles with little to no errors
- [ ] Boots a GameMaker game
- [ ] Decompiled code matches the runner
