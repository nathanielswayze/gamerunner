Decompilation and Open-Source Replacement of the GameMaker Studio runner providing backwards compatibility.

## Why make a project like this?
I've recently been researching code on the GameMaker data.win (or game.unx) file and was wondering why no one has attempted to research/decompile the GameMaker runner file, thus it led to this. I've also hated that runners aren't able to be backwards compatable with older game files.

## How can I contribute?
Right now this project is just in the early stages, so the best way you could contribute is by submitting either a [Pull Request](https://github.com/nathanielswayze/gamerunner/pulls) or an [Issue](https://github.com/nathanielswayze/gamerunner/issues) with any research or any decompiling code you would like to help with.

## What platforms are you going to target?
Some of the platforms that will no doubt be supported are:
- Windows
- Linux
- MacOSX
But I would love for an HTML build to be avaliable, as well as maybe an mobile target.

# Goals
- [ ] Compiles with little to no errors
- [ ] Boots a GameMaker game
- [ ] Decompiled code matches the runner
- [ ] Boots on Linux
- [ ] Boots on Windows
- [ ] Boots on MacOS
- [ ] Compile an HTML build

## Closing notes
This project is just something I wanted to do in my freetime. If I ever decide to stop this project, I will post all the remaning/unfinished code I have of the project to a seperate branch.
